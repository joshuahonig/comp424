            <h2>About this Application</h2>
                <p>
                    This application was developed to fully utilize NASA's <a href="https://api.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">Mars Rover Imagery API</a>, 
                    and make browsing and selecting products from the API easier and more user-friendly. It includes a search functionality and an image viewer. 
                    Mars has sent multiple rovers to the planet Mars. These rovers have a connection back to Earth to transmit data generated from scientific experiments.
                    Some rovers also include cameras, and these rovers were programmed to have the ability to take pictures of the Martian surface and transmit them back to Earth.
                    NASA has made the images taken by these rovers available through this API. 
                </p>
            <h2>About the Rovers</h2>
            <h3>Spirit and Opportunity</h3>
            <p>Mars Exploration Rover - A, also called MER-2, or otherwise known as <i>Spirit</i>, was launched form Earth on June 10th, 2003. It landed on Mars on January 4th, 2004. <br> 
            Mars Exploration Rover - B, also called MER-1, or otherwise known as <i>Opportunity</i>, was launched from Earth on July 8th, 2003, landing on Mars January 25th, 2004. <br>
            The rovers are considered "twin" rovers and both had a planned mission of just 90 sols, or roughly 92.5 Earth days. They landed on opposite sides of the planet. 
            <i>Spirit</i> remained operational for 2,269 Earth days, and <i>Opportunity</i> remained operational for 5,498 Earth days. 
            <i>Spirit</i> was caught in sand in a position which prevented solar recharging of its batteries and last communicated with Earth on March 22nd, 2010. 
            <i>Opportunity</i> last communicated with Earth on June 10th, 2018 after being caught in a severe dust storm on Mars. 
            Both rovers have Front and Rear Hazard Avoidance Cameras, Navigation Cameras, Panoramic Cameras, and Mini-TES (Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer) sensors.
            <br>
            NASA ceased serving images for the two rovers from the Mars Rover Imagery API within the last year for unknown reasons. 
            <br></p>
            <h3>Curiosity</h3>
            <p><i>Curiosity</i> was launched from Earth on November 26th, 2011. It was launched with the intent of studying Mars' 
            climate and geology and determining whether certain areas of the planet were suitable for sustaining life. It had a planned mission of two years, 
            but this mission has been extended indefinitely. The rover remains operational and active, and continues to communicate with NASA. The rover has the ability to take photos,
            but NASA stopped serving photos taken after February of 2024 from the API for unknown reasons.  <br>
            The rover has Front and Rear Hazard Avoidance Cameras, a Mast Camera, a Mars Hand Lens and Mars Descent Imager, a Navigation Camera, and a Chemistry and Camera complex. </p>
            <h3>Perseverance</h3>
            <p><i>Perseverance</i> was launched from Earth on July 30th, 2020 and landed on Mars on February 18th, 2021. Its design is similar to Curiosity, though some components have been upgraded, and it has more sensors and cameras.
            Like Curiosity, one of the primary purposes of the rover is to seek conditions supporting life on Mars, or evidence of life that may have previously existed on the planet. <br>
            When it landed on Mars, <i>Perseverance</i> carried a mini-helicopter named <i>Ingenuity</i> with it, which at the time was only an experimental technology. <i>Ingenuity</i> successfully took flight, 
            making the first powered aircraft flight on another planet on April 19th, 2021. <i>Ingenuity</i> was retired on January 18th, 2024 after suffering damage to some or all of its rotor blades.  
            The rover has many cameras, including Up and Down-Look Cameras, Parachute Up-Look cameras, Left and Right Navigation Cameras, Mast Zoom Cameras, and multiple Left and Right Rear Hazard Avoidance Cameras, in addition to some scientific instruments. </p>
